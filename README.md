## Description
<p>A project created using <b>React</b>, <b>React Hooks</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>Tachyons CSS</b> deployed on <b>Repl.it</b></p>
<p><i>A huge thanks to Andrei Neagoie for creating <a href='https://zerotomastery.io/'>ZTM</a> to help encourage new developers like myself to pursue their passions!</i></p>
<p>A simple React app that displays a product and product rating card. This project was built to practice your React interview skills.</p>

## To Edit Repl.it:
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

## Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
